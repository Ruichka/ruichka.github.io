# Global map & sector travel 

Right now, all survival sectors are completely separate from eachother and there's no way to travel between them, the only cross-sector thing we got now is ATM account.

So, I suggest new thing - **the global map**!
It is only available in survival.
It is opened by pressing G or clicking respective icon in the topbar.
On global map, you can see all currently existent survival colonies, as well as empty asteroids and Empire bases.
You can click on them to get basic information about them.
To travel to another stellar objects, you need to build a Space Rocket. It costs 500 iron bars, 500 copper bars, 100 circuit boards, 25 glass, 50 meteorite and 1 escape pod.
For space rocket to launch, you need to have enough fuel. 
Each rocket has a menu you can access by pressing E. In this menu, there are 6 special slots and 20 inventory slots. In first special slot, you can put an escape pod. In other five special slots, you need to put fuel. Other inventory slots are used to contain whatever items you need. Putting an escape pod will add another 5 "escape pod" slots.
You can craft an escape pod for 40 iron bars, 40 copper bars, 10 circuit boards and 5 wires.

Rocket fuel tanks are made in "Rocket Fuel Production Station". It costs 80 iron bars, 50 copper bars, 10 circuit boards and 10 wires. For one rocket fuel tank, it needs to be supplied with 100L of oil, as well as 50 iron bars, 50 copper bars, 20 sulfur ore and 2 gel. Producing one rocket fuel tank takes 5 seconds. One rocket fuel tank contains 1000 fuel units. 1 fuel unit = 1 km.

When you are done, you can choose to take one of 5 seats - 1 pilot and 4 passenger. Only admins can take pilot seat. When pilot is ready, he can use global world map to choose travel destination and then click "Travel". After that, the rocket will arrive at new destination. Everyone will appear near the rocket's landing position, keeping their inventories. The new sector will be like normal sectors, except it can be taken by any teams.

To travel to another player's "home" sector, it needs to be: A. >30 days old / B. Have "protection" cooldown done. When you travel to it, you're by standard defined as neutral by the colony. You can attack the base only if the owner is online. When you attack one of the buildings or players, then colony automatically turns hostile to you and your "Raid" begins with it being announced to the colony. During the raid, you should destroy the player's colony. You and your teammates have only one life. If you die, you can either choose to spectate or rejoin your home colony. If all your team members die, then raid counts as unsuccessful and this colony gets 5 day protection granted. Only one raid can pass at the same time. Nobody can enter or leave the sector (by rocket) during the raid. If you manage to destroy 75% of the base, then raid counts as successful. You gain 25% raw materials of buildings destroyed, as well as 20% of colony gold. The colony gets 50 days protection from your faction and 20 days protection from others. You'll immediately get back to your previous location after that, together with the rocket. You can't build anything on enemy sectors.

Besides usual asteroid sectors, there are also planet sectors. Planets are divided into several sectors and can be either 4x2, 8x4 or 12x6 sectors size. You can travel between sectors by crossing their borders. You need an escape pod to enter the planet from space. When you launch to the planet sector, instead of spawning in a rocket, you spawn in a  escape pod. Escape pod contains all items you put into "Escape pod" slots. To get back to your rocket, you need to press "Go back" button in the escape pod. Escape pod will be craftable with 40 iron bars, 10 circuit boards and 5 wires. Planet sectors, different from asteroids, are pure and don't have any sky tiles in them.

All your survival sectors, by default, belong to your single un-customizable faction. The only editable setting you get is "Peaceful". You can't invade your own sectors, and their ownership solely belongs to you. No one else can take ownership of your worlds. Sole ownership of a sector gives you 1/4 flight cost.

If you have gotten enough equipment, you can choose to "colonise" a neutral asteroid or planet sector. You can do that by building structures on it. Once you get an oxygenated room with furnace, you automatically get assigned to list of owners of that neutral sector. If you are an owner of a neutral sector, flights here take twice as less fuel. If you have survived for 20 in-game days (50 for planets) and there are no other owners present on the neutral sector, you will count as it's sole owner.

If you want, you can create a faction. Faction unites sectors owned by its members. Faction owner can create certain "roles", like in worlds. By default, there are only "Admiral", "Captain" and "Member" roles (their names are editable). Besides them, you can add 7 another roles. The permissions available are "Member Management", which allows player to add/kick faction members, and "Invasion", which allows player to commit raids. Player can choose which roles in his colonies he wants to give to certain faction roles and which colonies they can access. Owner can also toggle certain faction-wide settings:
- Peaceful. If toggled, this faction can't invade and can't be invaded. It has 48 hours toggle cooldown. Only factions with less than 10 colonised neutral worlds can have this disabled.
- MOTD. It is seen by all faction members in the faction tab. It contains editable text which can be used to show rules or targets.

Players in one faction can't invade eachother. Terminal has "Faction" chat which logs are kept and are seen across all faction worlds.
