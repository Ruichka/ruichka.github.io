<b>[uwc-ruika] Mindustry Logic - Unit-based Wireless Communication (Ruika's proposal)</b>

<b>Terminology:</b>
Manager - Logic module that is responsible for establishing & keeping wireless communication.
Listener - Logic module that is constantly monitoring for any inbound packets.
Sender - Logic module that is sending the data packet into network.
Node - Unit that is working as a network node.<br>
Packet - Set of information that is being sent over a node to a certain address.
Address - 8-bit value which is used to refer a certain group of receivers.

<b>Nodes & Packets</b>
Nodes are units which were chosen by Manager to serve that purpose.
Each unit in-game can have a flag which is basically a unit identificator that is allowing to separate units into groups.
Each flag is a 53-bit integer. UWC-Ruika uses flags as storage for information that is being transferred.
This protocol uses bit 1 (negative bit) to reserve that unit for UWC-Ruika protocol. Flag is divided as follows:

| 1             | 2 ... 53 |
| Reserving bit | Packet   |

Packet is also divided into several parts:

| 2   3 | 4 ... 11 | 12 ... 53 |
|-------|----------|-----------|
|AknwBit| Address  |   Data    |

Aknowledgment Bits (2 - 3)
